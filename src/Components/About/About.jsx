            Hi there! I am a web developer with a Certificate IV in Information Technology from the Canberra Institute of Technology. During my studies, I gained knowledge in a wide range of web and application development technologies, such as front-end website development, database management, and system development using Object-Oriented languages.
            <br /><br />I had worked as a Civil Engineering consultant in Japan after graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Civil Engineering, and have decided to pursue a new career in Web Application / Software Development in Australia.
